#Customer Churn Prediction
##Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using various classification algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and tuning. The final model can be used to identify customers at risk of churning, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

##Data
The dataset used in this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which includes information about customers such as demographics, account information, and whether they have churned.

##Methodology
###Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
###Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of features and the target variable, and visualizing relationships between features and churn.
###Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might be relevant for predicting churn and normalizing numerical features.
###Model Building: Training classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
###Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
###Model Selection and Tuning: Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and fine-tuning its hyperparameters.
###Interpretation and Insights: Analyzing the model's feature importances to understand which factors contribute most to customer churn and deriving actionable insights.
###Deployment (Optional): Saving the trained model for deployment in a production environment and setting up a pipeline for regular model retraining and evaluation.
Results
###The Logistic Regression model was selected as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics. The model was then fine-tuned and evaluated, providing insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.

##Usage
The trained model can be used to predict churn for new customers. A pipeline for regular retraining and evaluation can be set up to ensure the model remains accurate over time.
